# ToggleViewExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

We have a toggle button to switch between gallery view and table view.
In this example we are using the combination of `ng-container` and `ng-template` to load either the `FsImageTabularViewComponent` or `FsImageGalleryViewComponent` based on the value to toggle variable!

**Project is under development, I am working on adding some beautiful and usable templates**
